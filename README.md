This demonstrates the versioned implementation of Docker using docker-compose and Nginx.

To use:

* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose up`
* Go to http://localhost/java/v1/ (or whichever version you'd like to see)
* And go to http://localhost/node/v1/ (or whichever version you'd like to see)
